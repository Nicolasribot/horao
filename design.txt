This is a simple spec sheet for the simple 3d viewer.

- layers can be added/removed (viewed or hidden) using their name as identifyer
- effects can be added/removed using a name
- 2D layers (raster or vector) are projected on surfaces (used as textures) that are nearly horizontal, a 3D layer to project on must be specified. If no 3D model is present, create a default plane with the same size as the layer.
- 3D models come either from postgis DB or from file (for postgis we may use ssh type syntax user@server, but the passwd is a problem)
#- syntax is in .json format (not fun to read/write and ~parse)
- data loading can be long, so the interpreter/loader and the viewer will run in different threads, nodes will be added to the scenegraph when ready.
